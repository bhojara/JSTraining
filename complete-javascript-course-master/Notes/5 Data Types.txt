The 7 Primitive Data Types:

The main three:
Number: Floating point numbers used for decimals and integers - let age = 23
String: Sequence of characters used for text - let firstName = "Jonas"; (always put in quotes)
Boolean: Logical type that can only be true or false used for taking decisions - let fullAge = true;

Others:
Undefined: Value taken by a variable that is not yet defined ('empty value') - let children;
Null: Also means 'empty value'
Symbol (ES2015): Value that is unique and cannot be changed
BigInt (ES2020): Larger integers than the Number type can hold

Value has type, NOT variable
