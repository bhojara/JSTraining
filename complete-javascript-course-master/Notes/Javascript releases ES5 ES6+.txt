Javascript releases ES5 ES6+

Mocha was first (1995), then became LiveScript then became Javascript
JavaScript has almost nothing to do with Java, they are different languages

2009 ES5 was released. 
Then it went to an annual release cycle in 2015 with ES6 (ES2015)

DONT BREAK THE WEB mindset. Backwards compatible to the beginning.
