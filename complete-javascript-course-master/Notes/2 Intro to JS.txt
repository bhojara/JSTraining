JavaScript is a high-level, object oriented, multi-paradigm programming language

High-level means we dont have to worry about complex stuff like memory management
Object-oriented means it is based on objects, for storing most kinds of data

Web pages consist of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
HTML -  The Content - stands for HyperText Markup Language1234. It is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications
CSS  - Presentation of the content - stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a stylesheet language used to add layout and visual effects to HTML elements
JavaScript plays a crucial role in modern web development. It is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages. Here are some of its key roles:

	Dynamic Content Updates: JavaScript enables web pages to update and display new content dynamically. This means that the page does not need to be reloaded for new content to appear.

	Interactive Features: JavaScript allows for the creation of interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, and more1. This enhances the user experience on the website.

	Client and Server-side Scripting: JavaScript is used both on the client-side and server-side, enabling responsive, interactive, and functionally rich experiences. Technologies like Node.js have expanded its versatility beyond browser-based scripts.

	Asynchronous Data Loading: JavaScriptâ€™s dynamic capabilities allow for asynchronous data loading with AJAX, reducing server load through client-side scripting.

	Integration with APIs: JavaScript can utilize APIs for enriched web features.

	Cross-platform Compatibility: As an interpreted language, JavaScript navigates cross-platform challenges.

Think of HTML as the noun - the thing
Think of CSS as the adjective - describe the thing
Think of JS as the verb - what the thing does
